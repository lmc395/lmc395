Hey there. My name's Lucas. I'm a hobbyist technical writer looking to make myself useful. I'm not much of a programmer myself, but I'm fluent in a few languages (Python, Java, and C# by extension, apparently), and I'd like to think I'm capable of learning whatever more I need to get the job done. That said, I feel more comfortable writing documentation for users than developers. Need a hand? Don't be afraid to reach out!
